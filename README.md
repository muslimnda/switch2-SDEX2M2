## How is this possible?

This is possible because the Nintendo Switch 2's MicroSD Express slot supports the SD Express 7.1 standard, which exposes a **true PCIe Gen3 x1 interface** and utilizes the **NVMe protocol** for communication.

This adapter simply maps PCIe x1 from the Switch 2’s MicroSD Express slot to a standard M.2 2230 NVMe SSD. After further research and review from users, an onboard mcu will be required for the handshake provess with the Switch 2.

Currently, a MicroSD Express breakbout is being developed to start this process.

## Goals

- ✅ Create Pinout & Pin Definitions (UPDATED!)
- ✅ Create Footprints for MicroSD Express
- ✅ Create Schematic for PCB layout
- ✅ Create Dummy MicroSD Express Card V2
- 🔲 Create Dummy MicroSD Express card with breakout for prototyping
- 🔲 Create routed PCB with Gerber/Drill files
- ✅ Create BOM for fabrication and sourcing
- 🔲 (Optional) Offload VDD externally for higher-power drives
- 🔲 Produce & Test

## Status

Work in progress.  
We are actively developing the PCB layout, and testing.

There is still the possibility that there are power-related issues (ie: power draw of M.2 drives is more than the Switch 2 can push out), but a basic level of power filtering has been added to hopefully help a connection be established.

## Warnings

- Use at your own risk. We are **not liable** for any damage to your drive, Switch 2, or other devices.
- Only use **low-voltage, low-power M.2 2230 NVMe drives**.
- **Do not use this in legacy MicroSD slots** (e.g., original Nintendo Switch).
- This project is for **accessibility/educational use only**.  No commercial or piracy use permitted.

The optional resistor is for the PERST# lane, may help with state when idle. Not sure if needed until prototyping commences.
